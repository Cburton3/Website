#This will be my first website. Hopefully by the time you're reading this it will be decent enough to pass an interview! I decided to use my hobbies and interests in this one: principally Hiking or Camping.
I try to get out as much as I can and in the south of Spain where I live I have covered every major national park. These are just 3 trips I made over a month to give an idea of the spectacular beautiful hidden to most. 
There are some tips on how to plan (though I am by no means a professional) based on the last 5 years of exp, a list of basic equipment some examples of nice places to visit.
