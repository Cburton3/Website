        <ul>

            Apps: for free style hiking the most important apps to use are
            maps.me and mappy
            <p>
              Maps.me is easy to use and recommended for beginners as marking
              important viewpoints, ruins, and water sources such as fountains
              and waterfalls is especially easy. Calculating distances and
              plotting a trek are also very user friendly and you can downloaded
              the maps before hand so there is no worry if you loose your gps
              connection. However there are many paths that are private property
              or simply dont exist anymore and going down the wrong one only to
              come back up lost several times is an absolute nightmare. for
              finding places
            </p>
            <p>
              Mappy, in addition to all of the above has the huge benefit of
              showing you not just all the paths of maps.me but also the offical
              hiking paths specially marked in red, yellow and green so that you
              can rest assured that those paths are taken care of (no cutting up
              your shins on brambles!) and well signposted. They also usually go
              via some viewpoints and watersources
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Plotting your hikes: where, when and how long?
            <p>
              When plotting your hikes you must take care to go via as many
              water sources as possible. Take water pills even if the maps mark
              lots of fountains as some could be turned off. Extremely fit and
              experienced people will go from mountain peak to peak. This is
              damned right stupid if your not a professional. Firstly there are
              few animals at the very top of any mountain, zero flora to enjoy,
              no protection against the sun and climbing just 400m with a heavy
              bag could easily be dangerous to your health in heat. Fit people
              can do up to 1000m but don't count on enjoying the next day cos
              you won't. In hot weather stick to hikes that are wooded for
              protection against the heat and sun. In winter don't consider
              capming unless you spent 500â‚¬ on a sleeping bag and for the rest
              of the year always estimate 5 degrees less than what the weather
              says. Buying thermal cloths as pj's is a very economic way to save
              money on 4 season sleeping bags.

            Additional Material for Camping
            <p>
              This depends greatly for each individual. I personally enjoy a bit
              of comfort after lugging around a massive rucksack for 20km. As
              such I opt for a portable shower (weighs little) an inflatable
              mattress (a few hundred grams-the space is the bigger issue),
              inflatable pillow, sleepign bag (3 seasons is enough if your not
              camping in winter), biodegrabable shower gel and shampoo, towel,
              wet wipes (always have as spare in case there is no water and
              can't shower). For cooking you'll need a portable pot, a
              burner,light, spoon and fork (sporks are just uncomfortable and
              impractical in my opinion), chopsticks if you can use them (easy
              to transport), cup and dry food such as noodles, meatballs or any
              personal preference which is lightweight. I found taking sackets
              of Coffee or hot chocolate great increase the mood in the morning.
              For breakfast I recommend oats with powered milk or quaker oats
              which are so sweet you dont even need milk.
